### Where is the parsed data stored?
Data is stored in a sqlite db file called **data.db** that gets created in the output folder once parsing starts. 

### Markdown
The tool can also generate a markdown file of the parsed data that can be converted to HTML or PDF (using another tool) if the type is set to **markdown**.
An example pdf that was created from the generated markdown file and the provided css file `markdown-pdf.css` can be found in the `example` folder.
